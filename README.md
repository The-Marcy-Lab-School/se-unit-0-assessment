# Unit 0 Lesson 1 Assessment - Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Directions
Open the `assessment.md` file and answer each question. **Be sure to practice good markdown formatting**. You can either:

1. Edit the `assessment.md` file using the Github UI in the browser, **OR**
2. Clone down this repository to you local machine, make the appropriate changes to `answers.md`, then commit and push your changes back up to Github.
3. **Double check that your Markdown formatting appears correctly in your remote repo.**
4. Submit the URL of your repo to Canvas.

You must commit your changes and _submit the URL of this remote repo through Canvas_ in order to complete this assessment. 


## Assessment Criteria
We will be grading your assessments on two criteria:
1. **Clarity of Communication**  
  We expect you to write in complete sentences while paying close attention to grammar and spelling. For our assessments, _how_ you communicate is just as important as _what_ you communicate. Each of the questions above should be **answered in 1-3 sentences**. They should not be much longer than that. If you are taking much longer to get your point across, it is probably an indicator that you have some more studying to do. ðŸ¤“

2. **Accuracy of Your Mental Model**  
  I am not testing your ability to memorize definitions that come from a book. By answering these questions **in your own words**, you are communicating to me that you understand the _what_ and _why_ behind each of these key concepts. Remember: _Your words are your world._ Use the vocabulary of the unit to communicate with accuracy and precision.
